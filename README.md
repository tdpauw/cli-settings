# cli-settings
Stores the settings for [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Apparix](http://micans.org/apparix/).

## Usage
The settings make use of [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it), a community BASH framework with autocompletion, themes, aliases and custom functions.

To make use of these cli-settings:
* Fork the repository.
* Clone it locally.
* Run `install.sh` which will add symbolic links in the home directory to project files.
* Start making modifications as you wish.
